# SFTP-Client
A SFTP client program that I made during a programming course in university. 

Instructions:
1. Download the jar file.
2. Open CMD and navigate to dir where the SFTPClient.jar file is located
3. Run the command: java -jar SFTPClient.jar 
4. Enter IP, username and password to your SFTP-server and click connect. (If you dont have one, you can use Rebex free SFTP server: https://www.rebex.net/tiny-sftp-server/)
